      <description>This topic of this project is to develop a data product predicting the next word when users are texting on their smartphone keyboard. The database used to train the model can be accessed via this link. The database is comprised of 4 sub-databases, each of which corresponds to each language. In this project, the focus is on the English sub-database. The text data within the English sub-database are collected from 3 different types of media:</description>

      <description>This topic of this project is on traffic collisions in Halifax Regional Municipality (HRM) over the period of 2018-2021. The project will find out the tendency of traffic accidents in terms of time, space as well as characteristics related to collisions, roads and drivers. In addition, the project will perform hypothesis testing to make inference from the data of HRM. Lastly, a predictive model will be built to make a prediction on the number of daily incidents occurring in HRM.</description>
